# GitHub Project Tweaks Browser Extension

This browser extension adds some features to the GitHub projects and project boards that at the time of the creation of the extension where missing.

For example a work-in-progress (WiP) limit.

Best case scenario this extension will be obsolete one day because GitHub offers the features out of the box.

## Dependencies

Requires Firefox. No external libraries necessary.
