# GitHub Project Tweaks Browser Extension 0.2.0, released 2023-04-??

Code name: User-friendly durations

## Summary

Version 0.2.0 lets users handle durations (like for example effort) in a more user-friendly way than just a floating point number that represents the number of days. For example instead of 34.25 (days) a duration is represented by the string `6w 4d 2h`.

### Known Limitations

* Currently, you need to reload the page when the WiP limit of a column is changed.
* So far only tested on Firefox, other browsers might work, but there is no guarantee.

## Features / Enhancements

* #10: User-friendly duration display
